Full stack web application that uses MongoDB, Express, JavaScript, BootStrap, and Node.js.
This project was initially started by following Colt Steele's Web Development Bootcamp course on Udemy and copies many elements from his "YelpCamp." From there, I have begun to add my own styling and features, mostly trying to draw inspiration from, and copy, the website Hip Camp.

Features: - User registration and serialization with Passport - Input sanitization - Cloudinary API for image hosting - Mapbox API for map display - Basic search functionality - User generated content including posts, comments, and 1-5 star reviews

Functions not working/in progress: - More robust user dashboard - Buttons (except for the search) on the landing page are just for looks - Map display glitching out when only one search result is returned
